# TastyFrontendApp

A social media app designed mostly to share recipes with others - think Instagram but with cooking add-on.

Project works well on both pc desktop and mobile phone and is responsive.

Currently working features are creating an account, creating posts and liking them (sort of).

1. Account creation doesnt log you in so you have to use the log in form after you make an account.
2. You can use your profile picture to navigate to your profile and home button to go to your feed.
3. Navigating to profiles of others also works.
4. Liking a post works in the sence that it remembers the fact that you liked the post but currently doesnt give you anything.
5. To show the recipe click on the bars button in the middle of the post. The biggest one, it's hard to miss.


If you want to add a post navigate to your profile and it should be clear enough what to do next. 
Please take into account that free heroku servers are not the fastest to respond - especially on the first request when they need to wake up.

Many buttons and functionalities are not implemented yet and may never will be.

My thaughts:
This project was my way of learing JS and I think it's not that hard to tell what code I made at the beginning.
It has served it's purpose and was quite enjoyable. I managed to create somewhat of a really bad JS framework of my own and implemented my own JWT.
Now I consider it mostly dead but I may come back to it to tie up all the loose ends.
